## Machine Learning Lesson

This is an exercise that corresponds to a lesson on using Jupyter notebooks.

This notebook demonstrates how to to use scikit-learn for performing both a linear-regression and random-forest model for prediction. 

In the linear regression model, we use sample data of weight and heights of 10,000 individuals, and see if we can develop a model to predict how much someone might weight based on their height. (Purposely used this data to explain the pitfalls of such a model.)

In the random forest data, we use sample data of 13,000 recipes from Epicurious to see if we can develop a model that would predict the rating (1 to 5) of a recipe given a particular set of nutritional values.
